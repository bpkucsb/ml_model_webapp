I use the dash module from plotly to create a simple web app that loads data and uses the ML models from creditworthiness_ml_model repo. The user can input his or her income, debt and purpose of the loan and get scored by the model. The histograms for these features are also displayed.

Still need to add CCS to make web app pretty,
